# Hello, world!

This is version 1.0 of a simple hello world program whose purpose is not to
illustrate how to program, but what to do after the program is finished.
Namely, how to publish a piece of software under the GPL and package it for
distribution in Debian systems.

## Installation

See INSTALL file for building and installation instructions.

## Usage

Running

    $ hello-world

Should yield the message

    Hello, world!

## Source tree

The source tree purposely borders on the trivial. It contains a `main.c` - the
entry point for the application -  and the respective `Makefile` in the root
directory.
